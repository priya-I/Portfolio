This classifier classifies the tweets appearing on the user's home timeline into Sports, Finance, Technology, Entertainment and Others.\r\n### [Code](https://github.com/priya-I/Twist)\r\n***\r\n## Avaaj Otalo - Data Visualization\r\n### Visualization of the usage logs of a project called 'Avaaj Otalo' based out of rural India. This platform is used by the farmers to get their agricultural questions answered. Topics range from fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, seasons to harvesting.\r\n### [Visualization](priya-i.github.io/visualize-ao)\r\n\r\n***\r\n## Avaaj Otalo - Topic Predictor\r\n### Predicted the topics that farmers would call about next on the Avaaj Otalo Platform based on the time of the year, farmer's village and the crop.\r\n### [Code & Documentation](https://github.com/priya-I/AOMining)\r\n***\r\n## Exoskeleton Controller with Visual Feedback\r\n### Our project aims to improve the user interface of an existing wired controller for an exoskeleton (exo) which helps paraplegics walk with more natural strides. Aside from converting to a wireless controller, we plan to design a more intuitive user interface which not only removes the “unknown” for users during exo operations by providing instant feedback to instill a sense of security, but also accommodates varying stride lengths during walking. To accomplish our goals, we will combine user input and mechanical output with visual feedback.\r\n### Photos: Coming soon!\r\n\r\n***\r\n# **Research Papers**\r\n## Mobile Phones and Women Empowerment in Rural India\r\n### Course: Social and Organizational Issues of Information\r\n### [Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/70q36un4fbxha6e/Mobile%20Phones%20and%20Women%20Empowerment.pdf)\r\n## Strategy for NextDrop\r\n### Course: Introduction to Management of Technology\r\n### [Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gd30lyjg0z1qi5r/NextDropStrategy.pdf)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# **Courses**\r\n###* Information Organization and Retrieval\r\n###* Information Law and Policy\r\n###* Analyzing Big Data with Twitter\r\n###* Quantitative Methods for Data Analysis\r\n###* Social and Organizational Issues of Information\r\n###* Introduction to Management of Technology\r\n###* Data Mining and Analytics in Intelligent Business Services\r\n###* Information Visualization\r\n###* Strategic Management of Non Profit Organizations\r\n###* Natural Language Processing\r\n###* Python for Data Science\r\n###* Tangible User Interfaces\r\n***\r\n\r\n# [About Me](http://about.me/priya.iyer) \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# [School](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/students/priyaiyer) \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# [Resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1wb798flvcz8fwe/DataAnalystResume_IyerPriya.pdf) \r\n\r\n***","google":"UA-44813344-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
